### A Language for Constructing Finite State Machines in Hardware
Leonard Truong

* What is the goal of the project? What problem are you trying to solve?
In the 1980s, as hardware design shifted to VLSI, "modern" HDLs such as Verilog
and VHDL emerged as tools for circuit designers to document and simulate
existing circuit designs. Then, the application of logic synthesis allowed HDL
source files to be compiled into manufacturable netlist descriptions in terms
of gates and transistors.  The productivity advantage of synthesizable HDLs
outweighed the cost of the typically less area-efficient and less performant
circuits.

TODO: most of the work in HDLs since has been improving Verilog

Unlike hardware description languages, the domain of software programming
languages has a colorful history.  A truncated list of languages introduced
in the 1990s:
* 1990 – Haskell
* 1991 – Python
* 1991 – Visual Basic
* 1993 – Ruby
* 1993 – Lua
* 1993 – R
* 1995 – Java
* 1995 – JavaScript
* 1995 – PHP
The vast space of software applications and their different characteristics has
lead to the development of many programming languages, models, and paradigms.
The diverse landscape of software programming languages allows software
architects to choose the right tool for the application. For example, a dynamic
language like Python might be chosen to implement a web service where raw
performance is not as important as rapid feature development, while C might be
chosen for a real-time image processing application.  Hardware designers are
not afforded this luxury of choice.

* Why is it interesting, challenging, or important about the project?

* What previous work has been performed in this area?
  What resources do you plan on drawing upon?
